MONGODB_URI → your MongoDB Atlas connection string

MONGODB_DB → iwetechs (or any db name)

GMAIL_USER → sujalkakadiya1296@gmail.com

GMAIL_APP_PASS → Gmail App Password (create at Google Account → Security → App passwords)

NOTIFY_TO → sujalkakadiya1296@gmail.com



Got it — you want real, shared comments (visible to everyone on your site), plus an email to you whenever someone submits one — and you don’t want any CSS changes. Below is a drop-in, Vercel-friendly solution:

A tiny serverless API (/api/comments) that saves comments to MongoDB Atlas and emails you via Gmail (Nodemailer).

Minimal edits in your React file to use that API instead of the mock jsonplaceholder.

No CSS touches.
